# Simple Order-Taking Chatbot

## Description

This is a simple chatbot that allows users to place orders through a chat interface built with Gradio and Python, leveraging the OpenAI library for natural language processing. Users can choose between several kinds of stores and different GPT models. Once the order is placed, the chatbot sends a confirmation and the details of the order to the user's email. This project is designed to be easy to deploy and use, making it suitable for small businesses or personal projects.
